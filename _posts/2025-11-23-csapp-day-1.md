# Section 1.2
## Compilation System
![Compilation System](compilation-system.png)

### Phases
1. **Preprocessing phase**: The preprocessor (`cpp`) modifies the original C program according to directives that begin with the '#' character (such as `#include <stdio.h>`).
2. **Compilation phase**: The compiler (`cc1`) translates the text file `hello.i` into the text file `hello.s`, which contains an assembly-language program. Assembly language is useful because it provides a common output language for different compilers for different high-level languages.
3. **Assembly phase**: The assembler (`as`) translates `hello.s` into machine-language instructions, packages them in a form known as a relocatable object program, and stores the result in the binary object file `hello.o`.
4. **Linking phase**: The linker (`ld`) handles the merging of the precompiled object file `hello.o` with the `printf` function which is part of the standard C library provided by every C compiler. The result is the `hello` file, which is a binary executable object file (or simply executable) that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system.

### Practice
I'll use my Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine for many CS:APP experiments.

To examine the compilation system, you can use either methods:

A. Use `cpp`, `cc1`, `as`, and `ld` as the book guides.

B. Use `gcc`. This one is more handy and you'll patronize it soon.

Before you begin, you need to check whether you have the tools on your system by typing these:
```bash
# For the first method:
cpp --version
as --version
ld --version

# For the second method:
gcc --version
```

If you miss something, run these commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

And write a simple C source code `hello.c` with your favorite editor. I'll use Vim for it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("Hello, world!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

Small tips for Vim: Type `vim hello.c` on the terminal, press `i` key, write the source, press `ESC`, and type `:wq`. It will save the source and immediately exit Vim.

#### A. Using separate tools


#### B. Using GCC
